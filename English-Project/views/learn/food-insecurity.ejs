        <h1 class="text-center mb-4">Understanding Food Insecurity: A Data-Driven Approach</h1>
        
        <div class="abstract-section">
            <h2>Research Overview</h2>
            <p>Food disparity is an international trend, driven by inefficiencies in poorly developed food distribution and agricultural infrastructure. Recent studies estimate post-harvest losses as key intervention points, with global median losses at 19.8%. India, as a major producer of most food commodities in agriculture, has relatively low post-harvest losses (3.2%), yet suffers from chronic hunger, ranking 111th out of 125 countries on the Global Hunger Index.</p>
            
            <p>This study utilized machine learning (ML) models in the form of gradient boosting regression to analyze Indian farm data, including such variables as pesticide, fertilizer, farm size, crop type, harvest date, and climatic conditions. The optimal model had an R² measure of 0.999 in predicting best farming practice based on local conditions. The optimization model increased food retention after post-harvest by 3.42% over modern methods, bringing food into the supply chain at no extra cost.</p>

        <div class="introduction-section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Food waste and inequality are closely linked global challenges with significant implications for environmental sustainability and public health, especially among adolescents. Food inequality, defined as insufficient access to safe, nutritious, and adequate food, affects populations across both high- and low-income countries. Economic, social, and cultural barriers further limit food access for youth, hindering physical and cognitive development and undermining long-term health equity.</p>
            
            <p>In sub-Saharan Africa, post-harvest losses account for up to 40 percent of food waste, increasing prices and making healthy diets unaffordable for millions. In high-income settings, 24.8 percent of adolescents in the United States live in food-insecure households, a condition associated with elevated cardiovascular risk and impaired growth and learning outcomes.</p>
            
            <p>This study focuses on India using AI models in crop yield prediction and optimizing the use of inputs, while differing from approaches in Tanzania and Malawi where the focus has been on more community-based methods such as upgrading networks of farmers, cooperative storage systems, and local infrastructure upgradation. In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2 "Zero Hunger," we explore how AI can be applied to reduce food wastage across farms, retail, and households to optimize food inequality and promote food accessibility amongst adolescents and populations at risk around the world.</p>
